        <p id="projects">My website is going to be an ongoing project since it will require updating this project list.
        I am also planning to add on to the site in the future - I would like to possibly add a blog. As I learn new 
        skills, I will be trying them out on my site. At first I used <a id="inline-link" href="https://jekyllrb.com/"
        target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to build the site but then I scrapped most of it and built from scratch. The site uses 
        HTML, CSS and Bootstrap as well as Javascript. I plan to write about building the site in more detail once I have the blog up.</p>

        <h4><a id="git-links" href="https://inside.scrippscollege.edu/it" target="_blank"><b>Scripps IT Website</b></a></h4>
        <p id="projects">One of my job functions at Scripps is to create content for, and help maintain, the IT website using WordPress. The pages I
        update regularly are the <a id="inline-link" href="https://inside.scrippscollege.edu/it/self-installations" target="_blank">
        Self-Installations</a> page and the <a id="inline-link" href="https://inside.scrippscollege.edu/it/faq" target="_blank">
        Frequently Asked Questions</a> page. I create most of, if not all, the training documentation found on these pages. At least once
        a year I update the <a id="inline-link" href="https://inside.scrippscollege.edu/orientation/it" target="_blank">New Student IT
        Orientation</a> page and the <a id="inline-link" href="https://inside.scrippscollege.edu/it/2017-graduates" target="_blank">Graduate</a> page.
        My goal for the summer is to create training videos for the Self-Installations page.</p>

        <h4><a id="git-links" href="https://github.com/ztamayo/RHEL_server" target="_blank"><b>Red Hat System Administrator</b>
        </a></h4><p id="projects">I'm currently studying for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) certification.
        As a refresher I am taking the newly launched <a id="inline-link"
        href="https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-red-hat-enterprise-linux-red-hat-rh066x#!" target="_blank">Fundamentals 
        of Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a> on edX. The course recommends running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) server through 
        Amazon Web Services, which I have practiced on.  Mainly, however, I have RHEL 7 installed on a virtual machine (VirtualBox).
        The link on the title goes to a GitHub repo where I am storing screenshots from my work on the RHEL 7 VM.  I need to update
        the file names to more descriptive titles as well as add a lot more images.</p>

        <p id="projects">Lately I've been spending all of my free time on Lynda.com learning new skills or taking refresher courses.
        The link will take you to a page that lists my completed courses.  Courses of note are: UNIX for Mac OS X Users, Learning 
        MATLAB, Learning BASH Scripting and OS X Server Essential Training.  Courses that are next on my list: Project Management
        Foundations, DevOps Foundations, Learning Virtualization and AWS for DevOps.</p>

        Rails edX course. The edX site is a great resouce that contains many courses on various subjects, all for free. This is
        an intermediate RoR course - this and the advanced course lead to a certificate. I am taking this course and plan to take
        the advanced one after.</p>

        <h4><a id="git-links" href="https://www.codecademy.com/ztamayo" target="_blank"><b>Codecademy</b></a></h4>
        <p id="projects">This link will take you to my profile on Codecademy's website, which will hopefully show the
        courses I've completed. I am taking courses on Codecademy in my free time in order to refresh my skills and to
        learn new skills. So far I have completed the following courses: Ruby, Command Line, Making a Website, Responsive Design and
        Deploying a Website. My next goal is to work on the Python course.</p>

        <p id="projects">This link will take you to freeCodeCamp's website. I'm trying to work through freeCodeCamp's 
        certifications in my spare time. I haven't had much time to get back to this.  I'm currently in the first 
        step, which is Front End Development; I have completed HTML and CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery.</p>

                </h4><p id="projects">
                This is a website that I created in 2009 as a school project using <a id="inline-link" href="https://www.weebly.com/" target="_blank">
                Weebly.com</a>. I created an archive of the site and uploaded it into a GitHub repo located <a id="inline-link"
                href="https://github.com/ztamayo/Punk-Website" target="_blank">here</a>. I remember having a lot of fun with this
                project and doing way more than what was needed. I think this is when I first became interested in web development.
                This was my first serious exposure to HTML and CSS. The Weebly site has changed a lot since then; I remember being 
                able to create/edit the HTML and CSS, but now the site doesn't allow me to do so. To quote from my site:
            </p>
            <p id="projects"><i>"This website was created as a project for an American Cultures/Chicano Studies class entitled Digital Borderlands.  
                The purpose of this site is to inform people about Chicano Punk.  Punk music is usually associated with white males, and sometimes 
                it is associated with the negative connotations of anarchy and even white supremacy.  However, punk music is about rebellion and 
                social critique."</i></p>
